LiveSafe, brings together relevant information about disaster risks in a particular area within USA, to help the buying and renting decisions of potential homeowners.

## Project Description

* LiveSafe was a five week project carried out as part of Lambda Labs. Full stack developers and Data scientists worked together on this project.

* We worked on several datasets for fetching historical and predicted extreme events. Few major ones are listed below.

> [Disaster Declarations Summary](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/28318) from the **Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)**

> [Severe Storms and Extreme Events](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/severe-storms-and-extreme-events-data-table) from the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**

> [Localized Constructed Analogs](https://climate.azavea.com) from **University of California San Diego (USCD)**

> [Earth Quake Events](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat) from **Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS)**, a collaboration of **the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)**.

* The live application is hosted on netlify. [LiveSafe](https://livesafe.netlify.com)

* I was responsible for analysis and clean up of FEMA dataset, interfacing with Azavea Climate API for fetching future climate predictions, productization of data science backend to expose APIs for historical events and future events using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Flask and PostgreSQL.

* This application supports data analysis and map visualization of several location specific historical events. Different layers can be turned on or off.

**Historical event choropleth maps**

* Based on user's location of interest, this application supports detailed graphs on location specific historical events and future climate events.

**Past extreme events graphs**

**Predicted extreme events graphs**

**Individual extreme event graphs**

* LiveSafe application also supports selecting mutliple locations and compare the information between them.
