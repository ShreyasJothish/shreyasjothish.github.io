## [Supervised Machine Learning: Feature Engineering and Hyper Parameter Tuning](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-machine-learning-feature-engineering-and-hyper-parameter-tuning-a3da583dd7b9)
#### 7 Feb 2019

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Hyper-parameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyper-parameters for a learning algorithm. These impact model validation more as compared to choosing a particular model. Here I provide a step by step overview on Feature Engineering and Hyper Parameter Tuning.

Model validation is the process of evaluating a trained model on test data set. This provides the generalization ability of a trained model. Here I provide a step by step approach to complete first iteration of model validation in minutes.

There is a general belief, RTs are not endorsements. On contrary, retweets do suggest an inclination towards the tweet. Else why would one Retweet? Current analysis on social influence bases on Quoted tweet to Retweet ratio.
