---

Hi, I am Shreyas Jothish, machine learning engineer focused on helping institutions both tech start-ups and government, to improve the effectiveness of products and understand its impact on society. To do this, I have built the expertise in natural language processing and deploying machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised).

Being in telecom industry for 13 years and playing different roles ranging from software developer to system architect has taught me to collate, analyse and interpret data by means of code.

### Professional Career

I have prior experience of working with major information and communication technology companies like **Wipro Ltd, Huawei Technologies and Mavenir Systems**. Over the years I have played roles which included both technical and management.

### Projects

**politicallink**: I assessed the sentiment of re-tweets and quoted tweets to tweet from a prominent political personal and highlighted the risk of showcasing ones political inclination.
As part of the project I used python libraries, **tweepy** for accessing Twitter API), **textblob** for natural language processing, **pandas** for data wrangling and **seaborn** for visualization.
